pytorch/pytorch#172987,leveraging unified memory for mps tensors on apple silicone,"### 🚀 the feature, motivation and pitch ### background in the current pytorch mps backend, tensor backing buffers are allocated in the owner device’s private memory. when a tensor is moved between cpu and mps, pytorch: 1. allocates a new backing buffer in the destination device’s private memory. 2. encodes a metal operation to copy data from source to destination. this behavior is consistent and correct, but may not fully leverage the unified physical memory architecture of apple silicon. specifically in cases where the source and destination tensors are not modified, this results in two sets of identical buffers representing the same tensor on source and destination device. our proposal to address this issue is comprised of three parts: 1. allocate all tensors in unified memory instead of device's private memory. 2. in case of moving read-only tensors: since the data cannot be mutated, avoid duplication and of the source backing buffer, and instead reference the same unified memory for the destination tensor. 3. in case of assigning the result of a tensor move to itself: since source tensor and its backing buffer are discarded after device move, avoid duplication and of the source backing buffer, and instead reference the same unified memory for the destination tensor. ### proposal part 1 - allocate tensors in unified memory part 1 of the proposal is implemented and currently going through testing and verification. should parts 2 & 3 be rejected, part 1 can still be merged, as it is independent of the subsequent parts and can still provide performance benefits. **summary** instead of allocating tensor backing buffers in device-private memory by default, we propose allocating _all_ tensors in the unified (shared) memory accessible by both cpu and mps. under this model: - tensor device transfers (cpu ↔ mps) would still create a destination tensor with new ownership. - however, data movement would use a on unified memory plus a memory barrier, rather than a metal cpu ↔ mps operation where applicable. - this part of the proposal on its own is **not** intended to eliminate destination allocations for calls rather, it focuses on reducing the cost of data movement, when both source and destination backing buffers reside in unified memory. it also paves the way for the next parts of the proposal to specifically reduce memory duplication. **expected impact** - memory allocation size: no significant reduction expected in the general case. - transfer cost: potential reduction by replacing cpu ↔ gpu operations with lighter-weight calls on unified memory. - semantics: no change to pytorch tensor ownership or device semantics. **code changes** - tensor allocation [[emptytensor.cpp]( tensor allocation is performed by fetching an allocator class through the call. if device supports unified memory, we propose to pass for allocator creation. as a result, all tensors allocated through this allocator will reside in unified memory. - tensor device move [[copy.mm]( currently, during an cpu → mps copy, an explicit blit ( ) is encoded to move bytes from cpu-backed private memory into mps. this will no longer be needed as both source and destination will reside in shared memory. instead, we propose to perform a of the backing buffer on cpu-visible unified memory. since a mere does not carry tensor-specific information, we also manually perform cpu-side negation/conjugation if necessary, as well as to manually change ownership to . we also add a memory barrier ( ) to ensure writes to the tensor by source device are visible to the destination device. please note that at this stage memory duplication still occurs but it is on unified memory rather than device private memory. ### proposal part 2 - avoid duplication for read-only tensors **summary** with part 1 implemented, all tensors will reside in unified memory and be accessible from both cpu and mps. however, when a tensor is moved between devices, we cannot enforce source and destination tensors to reference the same backing buffer, as pytorch semantics require them to behave independently, i.e. write to either tensor should not modify the other. this problem does not however exist in case of read-only tensors, and we can reference the same memory with new device ownership instead of maintaining two copies of the same data. **code changes** still in progress and subject to approval of the proposal. **expected impact** - memory allocation size: reduction by 50% for read-only tensors, by maintaining a single copy of the backing buffer in unified memory for both source and destination tensors. - transfer cost: reduction by avoiding a on unified memory all together, and simply changing the tensor ownership. - semantics: mutable tensors will still maintain two copies for source and destination tensors. therefore, no change to pytorch tensor ownership or device semantics. ### proposal part 3 - avoid duplication when assigning a tensor device move to itself **summary** currently and with part 1 of the proposal in place, when the result of a tensor device move is assigned to itself ( ), a duplicate destination buffer is allocated and copied from source, and immediately after the source tensor is discarded and its backing buffer freed. this is equivalent to simply moving the backing buffer from one place of the unified memory to another. thus we propose to eliminate the unnecessary duplication, and simply reference the same source backing buffer with new ownership for the destination tensor. **code changes** still in progress and subject to approval of the proposal. we are also still investigating if it is possible to distinguish when a tensor device move is assigned to a new tensor vs. when it is assigned to itself. **expected impact** - memory allocation size: overall memory consumption should remain unchanged, but peak memory consumption has the potential to be reduced by reusing the source backing buffer. - transfer cost: reduction by avoiding a on unified memory all together, and simply changing the tensor ownership. - semantics: if both source and destination tensors remain alive, they will still maintain two copies for source and destination tensors. therefore, no change to pytorch tensor ownership or device semantics. ### alternatives instead of parts 2 & 3 of the proposal, a general copy-on-write implementation was also considered that would keep both source and destination tensors referencing the same backing buffer in unified memory, until either one was modified. however, as we understand, [the last copy-on-write attempt]( was ultimately rejected due to the design being too brittle. thus, we propose to reduce the optimization scope to read-only tensors and self-assigning device moves. ### additional context - part 1 of the proposal is implemented and currently at a 97% pass rate for . we are tracking down the remaining 3% failures. - parts 2 & 3 are still under investigation and not implemented. we hope to reach an understanding on whether or not these parts of the proposal in theory are acceptable to the maintainers before attempting to implement. cc",[],['FEATURE'],"['module: memory usage', 'triaged', 'enhancement', 'module: mps']",github,2026-01-21T20:57:45Z,,"leveraging unified memory for mps tensors on apple silicone ### 🚀 the feature, motivation and pitch ### background in the current pytorch mps backend, tensor backing buffers are allocated in the owner device’s private memory. when a tensor is moved between cpu and mps, pytorch: 1. allocates a new backing buffer in the destination device’s private memory. 2. encodes a metal operation to copy data from source to destination. this behavior is consistent and correct, but may not fully leverage the unified physical memory architecture of apple silicon. specifically in cases where the source and destination tensors are not modified, this results in two sets of identical buffers representing the same tensor on source and destination device. our proposal to address this issue is comprised of three parts: 1. allocate all tensors in unified memory instead of device's private memory. 2. in case of moving read-only tensors: since the data cannot be mutated, avoid duplication and of the source backing buffer, and instead reference the same unified memory for the destination tensor. 3. in case of assigning the result of a tensor move to itself: since source tensor and its backing buffer are discarded after device move, avoid duplication and of the source backing buffer, and instead reference the same unified memory for the destination tensor. ### proposal part 1 -

envoyproxy/envoy#43116,active health checks fail when using upstream tls with client certificate,"**description:** _prerequisites:_ - the cluster has a tls transport socket configured for upstream connections. -

**scenario 1:** the client gets a ""no healthy upstream"" error for 4 minutes after envoy restarts - this is counted from the moment envoy is back up and ready with all configuration from xds. it doesn't include the time envoy takes to be ready serve requests. -

[ ] removing existing functionality in pandas ### problem description pandas does not provide any method to measure the information loss which occurs when dataframe transformations are applied. data resolution decreases permanently through common operations because users cannot observe this reduction which results from rounding and binning and aggregation and encoding and filtering and deduplication. users create data compression that exceeds proper limits which leads to the loss of valuable information without their awareness. i want pandas to provide users with information loss measurements which show how transformations affect data processing because this will help them choose preprocessing methods and identify excessive operations which will improve their data pipeline trust. ### feature description the system will start tracking operational data transformations through its mandatory tracking system which will record every dataframe transformation that occurs. the feature would: - the system will calculate entropy values at the column level using shannon entropy for discrete data and histogram-based entropy for continuous data. - the system will measure information loss through its normalized entropy difference calculation which compares two different states. - the system will track information loss from operations that occur within a monitoring environment. example api: with df.track_information() as info: df[""price""] = df[""price""].round(0) df[""age_group""] = pd.cut(df[""age""], bins=5) info.report() conceptual implementation def entropy(series): if is_discrete(series): p = value_counts(series) / len(series) return -sum(p * log2(p)) else: bins = adaptive_bins(series) p = histogram(series, bins) / len(series) return -sum(p * log2(p)) the system performs lazy entropy calculations which apply to specific columns that undergo changes. the system applies adaptive binning to continuous data in order to produce consistent estimation results. the system calculates dataset-level information loss by summing all column-specific information losses. the feature requires user activation because it creates no performance impact until the user decides to use it. the system enables users to monitor dataframe transformation impacts on information content while maintaining the original pandas functional behavior. ### alternative solutions multiple different methods exist as potential alternatives for evaluation. relying on documentation or user discipline users would need to decide how much information they lost through their transformation work. the current system proves unmanageable because it creates errors while users cannot track the total impact which develops throughout their different workflows. heuristic warnings for specific operations pandas should develop a system which generates alerts about dangerous functions which include binning and rounding as destructive actions. the system would operate at a broad level but its results would not show the actual information loss degree which occurs through a specific dataset. downstream model metrics (e.g., feature importance, performance) the model behavior permits users to infer information loss yet this method only works during the machine learning stage and it does not serve general data analysis or reporting purposes. external profiling or data quality tools existing tools examine missing data and data distribution patterns and schema validation processes, but they lack the ability to monitor how data transformations create information loss which they can trace back to particular processes. the available alternatives failed to meet requirements because they lacked the ability to show information loss which occurs during pandas operations at both direct and transformation-level contexts. ### additional context _no response_",[],['FEATURE'],"['Enhancement', 'Closing Candidate']",github,2026-01-25T09:58:56Z,2026-01-27T17:50:37Z,"enh: data entropy & information loss tracking for dataframe transformations ### feature type -

version: commit 0de88768ee3b0a6c75d940668c4fc7ee89dddd3b (version 1.50.2) language: c++ ### what operating system (linux, windows,...) and version? ubuntu 24.04.2 lts (noble numbat) ### what runtime / compiler are you using (e.g. python version or version of gcc) gcc 13.3.0 ### what did you do? please provide either 1) a unit test for reproducing the bug or 2) specific steps for us to follow to reproduce the bug. if there’s not enough information to debug the problem, grpc team may close the issue at their discretion. you’re welcome to re-open the issue once you have a reproduction. setup: - server-side streaming rpc using serverwritereactor - server side has a built up message queue, our onwritedone callback pulls 1 message from the queue and calls startwrite in a loop - client connects via envoy proxy (grpc-web) with default stream_idle_timeout=300s - server streams large amounts of data (~13,000+ responses per stream) - client can cancel stream mid-flight by aborting the http/2 connection ### what did you expect to see? - when the frontend client aborts the http2 stream, there is always 1 pending write for which startwrite has been called but onwritedone has not, and i tested this with 100s of cancels and this is always the case - every onwritedone for the 1000s of messages before the stream cancels, each one takes 10s of ms from its accompanying startwrite with a ok=true return val - i expect this final ondonewrite to return with ok=false in this same 10ms period after its startwrite once the client is aborted as theres no where for grpc to write this message to ### what did you see instead?

please provide either 1) a unit test for reproducing the bug or 2) specific steps for us to follow to reproduce the bug. if there’s not enough information to debug the problem, grpc team may close the issue at their discretion. you’re welcome to re-open the issue once you have a reproduction. setup: - server-side streaming rpc using serverwritereactor - server side has a built up message queue, our onwritedone callback pulls 1 message from the queue and calls startwrite in a loop - client connects via envoy proxy (grpc-web) with default stream_idle_timeout=300s - server streams large amounts of data (~13,000+ responses per stream) - client can cancel stream mid-flight by aborting the http/2 connection ### what did you expect to see? - when the frontend client aborts the http2 stream, there is always 1 pending write for which startwrite has been called but onwritedone has not, and i tested this with 100s of cancels and this is always the case - every onwritedone for the 1000s of messages before the stream cancels, each one takes 10s of ms from its accompanying startwrite with a ok=true return val - i expect this final ondonewrite to return with ok=false in this same 10ms period after its startwrite once the client is aborted as theres no where for grpc to write this message to ### what did you see instead? - the currently in-flight startwrite() does not fail immediately - i observed onwritedone(ok=false) is not called for ~300 seconds - after exactly 300 seconds (envoy's stream_idle_timeout), onwritedone(ok=false) finally returns - this happens in every one of the 100s of frontend client aborts i tested - even when the client doesn't explicitly abort but starts a new streaming rpc on the same http/2 connection, the old reactor's pending startwrite() still blocks for 300s before onwritedone(ok=false). this makes it seem like grpc is prioritizing the new streams over the other still alive ones, as they share the same underlying tcp channel?
